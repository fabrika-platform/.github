**fabrika-platform** is a next-generation technology platform designed for the development, production, and integration of compact control systems and HMI interfaces. It combines professionally designed custom-made hardware with a flexible software ecosystem that is partially open-source and open to expansion. The platform is built to simplify the development of single-purpose devices, automation solutions, and smart installations â€” from industry to home.

## Key features

- **Hardware acceleration**  
  New generation microcontrollers with hardware acceleration for graphics and communication.

- **Industrial HMI panels**  
  Touch HMI panels meeting industry standards.

- **Open software foundation**  
  Freely available libraries and tools (LVGL, MQTT, REST API, Modbus, WebUI...).

- **Quality & stability**  
  Strong focus on quality, stability, and documentation.

## License and Accessibility

Hardware modules are designed and manufactured locally. Selected parts of the software are available under open licenses, while some libraries are closed to support and protect critical functionality. The goal is to balance development freedom with the quality of deployment reliability.

## Why fabrika-platform?

Most traditional HMI and PLC solutions are overly closed and difficult to adapt. **fabrika-platform** creates a bridge between industry standards and the open-source world, empowering you to build your own solutions.
